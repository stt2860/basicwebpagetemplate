# Basic Web Page Template repo

This repository provides the skeleton for creating a basic web page/site compiled using the `rmarkdown` package's built-in site generator, as in [Section 10.5](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html) of *R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*. It was created to serve as the starting point for a personal web page [assignment]((https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/DataScience1/Projects/Project00.html)) for students enrolled in [STT2860 Introduction to Data Management and Visualization](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/STT2860DataScience1/) at [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu/).
